<h1>Why is sleep important?</h1>
<p><em>By Sidney L</em></p>
<p>Zzzzzzzzzz! Zzzzzzzz! Every night you should find yourself sleeping anytime during the night. Experts say that sleeping is the most important thing of our life! Even more important than school! (Sorry teachers.) If you didn’t sleep, you would not be yourself. You would not of concentrated, got questions wrong you seriously already knew and you may not be attentive and social in class time. See, this is how important sleep is! Children in their school ages (9 – 13 years old) need 9-11 hours of sleep. They need way more sleep than adults because they learn new things every day. The information has to be stored in your brain so that you can refer to it later on. Keep reading to find out how important sleep is! (It really is important)   </p>
<p>Firstly, experts say that sleep is very important to you no matter what you think about it. If you think that sleeping is only for babies, or toddlers, think again! Adults have to sleep too! You need to sleep for 9 – 11 hours! You don’t sleep for 5 – 7 hours since it will make you drowsy when you get to school.<br>Experts say that                                                                               </p>
<ul>
<li>Newborns (0 – 3 months) have to sleep between 10.5 – 18 hours a day, </li>
<li>Infants (4 - 11 months) have to sleep between 9 – 12 hours a day, </li>
<li>Toddlers (1 – 2 years) have to sleep between 11 – 14 hours a day and  </li>
<li>School Aged Children (Like you!) (6 – 13 years) have to sleep between 9 – 11 hours a day</li>
</ul>
<p>See??? Everyone needs Sleep. No matter what your age is. </p>
<p>Secondly, sleeping at the wrong time can make you feel drowsy and tired. It can lower your concentration levels at school and getting questions wrong you know. Sleep can impact your whole day! If you sleep better, your life will be better! You will be happier, calmer and make strong decisions throughout the day. 
The day before a test, you really should sleep well, as I said, if you sleep for 7 hours that night, it is more likely  that you will get simple questions wrong. (For example 2+4=8!) No one would ever want to do that, would they? Sleep can help you a lot at school by either learning more or being more accurate. Treat every night and day as if you had a test every day! Nor will you sleep less neither make SILLY mistakes!  </p>
<p>Last, but definitely not the least, sleep can help you grow, now everyone knows that! (Well not that before you sleep you are 132 cm tall then the morning you wake up you are 190 cm!) You will grow slowly! But if you DON’T sleep you will stay at your height or even possibly shrink (not that much!) See, you can protect yourself a lot by just sleeping! You have to sleep no matter what you think you can do. All of you want to grow? Don’t you? </p>
<p>For all of the reasons above, experts say everyone should be sleeping at their designated times,  </p>
<ul>
<li>Newborns – 9 – 12 hours, </li>
<li>Infants – 10.5 – 18 hours, </li>
<li>Toddlers – 11 – 14 hours and  </li>
<li>School Aged Children – 9 – 11 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleeping can affect your daily life negatively and you alter your performance at school, you can misbehave, not think about strong and good choices and get questions wrong you already know. 
Sleeping can also help your growth and you can be way more beneficial by just… Sleeping!<br>So everyone, experts encourage you to sleep well and as you can see, you will have a happier life! 
What do you think? Are these hours appropriate, does sleep affect your mood? Do you think that you will grow taller? </p>
