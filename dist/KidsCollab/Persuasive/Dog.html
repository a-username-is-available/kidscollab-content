<h1>Dog</h1>
<p><em>By Sidney L</em>
Hi Mum and Dad, I want a new pet dog because dogs can keep you company; you can use it as a stress reliever; you can exercise at the same time as the dog does.
Firstly, dogs can keep your company when you are sad or angry. They can cheer you up! Everyone likes cheering up, right? Dogs really can be very powerful mentally. 
Secondly, you can use it as a stress reliever. If you are stressed, for example for an exam or an assignment, you can play with the dog and you will be brightened up just by the dogs.<br>Last but not least, everyone needs exercise. It can be more entertaining by doing it with your dog. It can be beneficial for both your dog and yourself.<br>In conclusion, I strongly believe that we should have a pet dog because dogs can keep you company; dogs can be stress relievers, and dogs can help you exercise. </p>
