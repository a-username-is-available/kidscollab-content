<h1>Razing</h1>
<p><em>By Nathan W</em></p>
<p>He rises, his eyes sullen and blank. He reaches for a photo, crinkles creasing on his face. But when he touches the frame, his mind flashes like lightning.
And now he is somewhere else, young but wounded, his fingers numb and his brain frozen. Bullets whip past his face but he does not see where they are from.
But he needs to do something.
He wraps his finger around the trigger, his mind swimming in agony. And then, blindly, he fires.
The he hears it.
The painful scream of his best friend, torn in many ways, a bullet embedded in his chest. Pure anguish resounds through the air. He topples over in a wide arc.
He does not get up.
The fighting continues but time stands still for him. He feels the pain grabbing at him, urging to give up.
Now he is back in the present, a veteran more dead than alive His face turns gaunt, but it is his heart that hurts the most. His home is gone, he has no reason to live. He has already destroyed his future. He is too stricken with guilt, too terrified to talk.
One word is stuck in his head.
