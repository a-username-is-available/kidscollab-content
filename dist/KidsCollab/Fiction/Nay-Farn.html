<h1>Nay-farn</h1>
<p><em>By Nathan W</em></p>
<p>Before anything was made, a glistening single cell appeared. It lived isolated several days in the deserted land it had appeared. The cell established the land as Nay-Farn. 
Suddenly, a tree materialised in Nay-Farn. The tree had orange leaves, a sturdy trunk and a perfect home for the cell. There was going to be a big change in Nay-Farn -the cell could feel it. 
The prediction was true; as a breeze swept across Nay-Farn, two holes formed in the tree’s trunk. New figures hopped out of a hole. They called themselves ANTS (Adam, Nathan, Thomas and Sidney) and respected the cell. 
Over 2 years, new characters appeared in Nay-Farn. There was Avy; a talking mirror, Captain Australia; he had a sword of vibranium and different species of wizards + astronomers. Nay-Farn was also home to Kim - Learners See and Sybill Fates (They invented The WickedWingWeb and Microhard-armour for the cell).
Something strange happened in Nay- Farn; the cell started to control everything. If the cell was happy, more characters hopped out of the tree; if the cell sad or sick, not many were produced. Life on Nay-Farn was blooming and becoming more and more diverse. 
One day in Nay-Farn, as colourful and happy as it usually was, Adam and Thomas disappeared. ANTS was no more. Instead, it was NS (Northern Sydney). Even that shock wasn’t enough to match what happened next: without a trace, the cell went missing. All throughout Nay-Farn there was panic. 
The next day, Nay-Farn awoke in distress as many characters went missing. A rescue group comprised of Apollo, NS, Captain Australia and Remus Lupin. The group decided to pass through the second hole. As they did though, all life disappeared in Nay-Farn. 
The group walked through some gates labelled ‘KNOWLEDGE’ but were stopped by some people wearing glasses. They asked Apollo how far from the Earth to the Moon. Apollo didn’t know so the guards took him captive. One by one the heroes were taken captive. Only NS survived. 
When NS had reached the end of the perilous land, they found a cell. They grabbed the cell and jumped to their land. There, everything had been repaired and the imprisoned characters were freed. All was well. But in the other side of Nay-Farn, the knowledge land had disappeared... </p>
