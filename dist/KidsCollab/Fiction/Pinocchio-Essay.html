<h1>Pinocchio</h1>
<p><em>By Nathan W</em></p>
<p>Do texts teach life lessons?</p>
<p>Displaying emotional and meaningful moments on the screen, movies are made to inspire and to leave a message with the viewer. In Guillermo Del Toro’s <em>Pinocchio</em> (2022) we see an immortal wooden puppet seeking acceptance going through fascist Italy with his grieving father trying to find him. Throughout <em>Pinocchio</em>, a moral we see is that death is part of what makes humans human through the view of Pinocchio and his interactions with Geppetto and the Wood Sprite and Death fairy. We also see how you don’t have to change to fit in, as the character of Pinocchio grows.</p>
<p>“So, I can never die?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but that is not a good thing, Pinocchio. For as long as this is true, you will NEVER be a real boy like Carlo”.</p>
<p>The above exchange is taken from when Pinocchio first encounters the Death Fairy and how Del Toro shows that life is fleeting, and we that should make the most of it. We start the movie with a grieving Geppetto lamenting his sad past, mourning Carlo, and wanting him back. He is haunted by the short life Carlo had. This is contrasted to Pinocchio, an immortal puppet, whose interactions with the Death Fairy define what a human is. We see that humans have death in their life, and how the characters grow from this. This is a major plot point of Candlewicks’ story arc as he decides to stand up to his father after being influenced by him for his whole life. We see Pinocchio go from proclaiming his immortality joyfully to sacrificing himself to become human. This is shown by a quote by Jack London: “I would rather be ashes then dust. I would rather live out my days in glory rather than become a sleepy permanent planet.” To be human means to live and ultimately die, not to exist for eternity. In Pinocchio’s final encounter with the Death Fairy, we see that Pinocchio accepts death as part of being human as he breaks the hourglass and goes back to save Geppetto. By the end, we finally get a definition from Sebastian J Cricket as Pinocchio heads into the wild. “Will he eventually die? I think so. And that will make him a real boy”. This line echoes the message that death is part of being human, so make the most of your life.</p>
<p>“Then I will be Pinocchio . . . and that will be good enough”.</p>
<p>Pinocchio, through the protagonists’ journeys showcases the lesson that change is not needed to fit in with society. Del Toro creates an intricate connection with the book Frankenstein, with similarities between how society rejects both protagonists and how both are cast out to navigate a dangerous world, in Pinocchio’s case, fascist Italy. Pinocchio is rejected on 2 fronts, through the church and through the military government. There is contrast behind how Pinocchio is found not to fit in. The church singles him out for his individual looks, while the military rejects him for his unique ideas. Even those that seem to support Pinocchio have an ulterior move. Count Volpe manipulates Pinocchio and doesn’t want his character, only his capability. Sebastian J. Cricket starts out only in it for a wish to start his career. And Geppetto, his “father” falls from the paramount pedestal as he initially created Pinocchio as a wish for him to become the boy he lost, and in a moment of anger call the marionette a burden. This makes Pinocchio feel left out and thinking that he is not right in this world. However, Del Toro turns this seemingly stark future for the puppet into a bright one. Count Volpe meets his end when he realises that his former slave is not just a puppet, Sebastian J. Cricket uses his wish to get Pinocchio back, and Geppetto realises that Pinocchio was good the way he was, and that he brought him such “terrible, terrible joy”. Further, Sebastian J. Cricket says at the end that the world embraced Pinocchio back, proving that Pinocchio did not have to change to fit in.  Through the Pinocchio’s interactions with other characters, Del Toro provides the moral that you do not have to change to fit in.</p>
<p>Del Toro, through <em>Pinocchio</em>, has given the audience his morals and life lessons. In the eyes of the wooden protagonist, we see that death is part of what makes a human human. And with Del Toro’s characters and their interactions we see that you do not have to change to fit in. <em>Pinocchio</em> shows how texts can teach life lessons.</p>
