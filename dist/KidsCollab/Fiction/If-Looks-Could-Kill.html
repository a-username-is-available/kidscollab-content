<h1>If Looks Could Kill</h1>
<p><em>By Nathan W</em></p>
<p>I stand with debris all around me. Beyond my vision there is more. A glare was all it took. It claimed the lives of many. I will tell it all. 
In Africa, at noon, a weary explorer sat down. Deep into a jungle, he was exhausted. When he glimpsed the plumage of the infamous bird of Aveminis. The worry lines etched in his forehead multiplied at an alarming rate. The bird was known for one glare from the bird&#39;s piercing eyes would surely put any life form to a painful peril. The panic-stricken explorer felt petrifying pain in his eyes as the bird turned its head sharply and once again slayed in seconds. 
When news of this tragedy reached his country, the slain explorer&#39;s anxious family grieved upon learning the news. They swore that they would avenge his death. Colleagues, companions and allies alike joined a colossal battalion. In a week, they were ready to strike. The adversaries? Africans.
Meanwhile the Africans watched over the growing army on the news and started piecing together their own platoon. When the Explorer’s Battalion reached Africa, the Africans were ready. The first order was “CHARGE!”
Swords swinging, shields flashing, the soldiers clashed. THUMP! An entire row was swept off their feet. Cries of agony was all that anyone could hear. Blood soaked the ground. No side seemed to have the advantage. At one point the Africans managed to win ground only to lose it in seconds. Bodies hit the ground, mortally wounded and too weak and frail to continue. They joined the many of the slaughtered. The battle raged until hundreds succumbed to wounds and to death. No one was in any condition to continue fighting. 
Spirits of battle lie on this field. Tons of blood were shed in this violent massacre. Weapons are scattered all over the battlefield. I am one of these dead spirits. My gut has an arrow buried in it. Battles are cruel. My heart aches when I remember my past- my wife, my kids, my job and my friends. I will never see them again. One look, one stare, the result.</p>
