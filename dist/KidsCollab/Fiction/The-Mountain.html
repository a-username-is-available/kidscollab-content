<h1>The Mountain</h1>
<p><em>By Sidney L</em></p>
<p>Humph, humph, humph.</p>
<p>Adam, the dogs and I were having a jaunt in the desert. How unconventional! I hear you declare. Well, as a fact, it was a bourgeois thing to do in the desert because we lived there! Abruptly, &quot;Ahhh!&quot; I heeded a voice and turned abaft to witness an aghast Adam. I didn&#39;t know what was unsound! I couldn&#39;t see Pepper! Adam was perilously searching around for that beloved black dog that was drowned in the sandy mountains. In a pronto, I was miraculously searching too.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen next?</p>
