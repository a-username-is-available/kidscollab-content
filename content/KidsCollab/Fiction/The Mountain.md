#The Mountain

*By Sidney L*

Humph, humph, humph.

Adam, the dogs and I were having a jaunt in the desert. How unconventional! I hear you declare. Well, as a fact, it was a bourgeois thing to do in the desert because we lived there! Abruptly, "Ahhh!" I heeded a voice and turned abaft to witness an aghast Adam. I didn't know what was unsound! I couldn't see Pepper! Adam was perilously searching around for that beloved black dog that was drowned in the sandy mountains. In a pronto, I was miraculously searching too.

What do you think will happen next?
